# armsimweb
a webified version of an armv8 simulator I'm working on.

A class on machine organization I took last semester used an armv8 simulator to grade our code for quizzes
and I thought it was so cool that I wanted to make my own in hopes that it would improve my understanding of
how programming languages and computers work. I think it's done that but only time will tell.

Completed features:
 - arithmetic (add, sub, mul, no div)
 - mov
 - labels, cmp, and branching (b, cbz, cbnz, b.gt, b.lt, b.eq, b.ge, b.le)

Future features (hopefully):
 - str, ldr, and working stack and heap
 - printing and handling strings
 - some css to make it less ugly
